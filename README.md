- Android WorkManager is a `background processing` library which is used to execute background tasks which should run in a guaranteed way but not necessarily immediately. 

- With WorkManager we can `enqueue our background processing` even when the app is not running and the device is rebooted for some reason. 
- WorkManager also lets us define constraints necessary to run the task e.g. network availability before starting the background task.
